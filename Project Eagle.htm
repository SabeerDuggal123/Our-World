<H2>NOW WHAT IS ALL THIS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE?</H2>
<B><H3>GREENHOUSE EFFECT</H3><B>
THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT IS THE REASON WHY WE ALL DO NOT FREEZE TO DEATH
HERE ON EARTH. CERTAIN GASES IN THE ATMOSPHERE LIKE CARBON DI-OXIDE
AND METHANE(CALLED GREENHOUSE GASES) TRAP THE HEAT RAYS BOUNCING BACK INTO SPACE AND PREVENTING
THEM FROM ESCAPE. THIS ENSURES THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH DOES NOT
DROP BELOW -18 DEGREE CELSIUS. THIS TRAPPING OF HEAT RADIATION FROM THE
SUN BY GREENHOUSE GASES IS CALLED GREEN HOUSE EFFECT.

<B><H3>BUT HOW'S THIS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE</H3></B>
EXCESS OF GREENHOUSE GASES CAN INCREASE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH MORE
THAN REQUIRED. THIS CAUSE MELTING OF THE POLAR ICE. THIS WILL RISE THE SEA 
LEVELS AND RESULT IN THE SINKING OF COSTAL TOWNS AND CITIES, CROP FALIURE
ETC. IT WOULD BE DEVESTATING FOR ALL OF US.THE PLANET VENUS EXPERIENCED RUNAWAY GREENHOUSE EFFECT, RESULTING IN AN ATMOSPHERE WHICH IS 96% CARBON DIOXIDE, 
WITH SURFACE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE ROUGHLY THE SAME AS FOUND 900 M (3,000 FT) 
UNDERWATER ON EARTH. VENUS MAY HAVE HAD WATER OCEANS, BUT THEY WOULD HAVE BOILED OFF AS THE MEAN SURFACE TEMPERATURE ROSE TO THE CURRENT 735 K (462 °C; 863 °F).

<b><H3>HOW CAN WE HELP?</H3></B>
WE CAN HELP. ONE OF THE BEST THINGS WE CAN DO IS TO SPREAD THE IMFORMATION
OF THE DANGER POSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND GLOBAL WARMING. ALSO, WE SHOULD
REDUCE THE USE OF PLASTCS, RECYCLE PAPER AND METALS, AND OF COURSE, <U>PLANT
MORE TREES.
